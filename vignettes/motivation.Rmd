## Doesen't R already have exceptions and `try-catch` mechanics?

Yes!

R already has a very flexible and useful condition signalling system that
is the basis for emitting messages, warnings, and errors - exceptions that
bubble up and either crash the executing program / function, or are caught and
handled by a matching exception handling function.

This base system was much improved by functionality implemented in the `rlang`
package, such as call-stack trimming and making it trivial to make rich error
messages and custom error/warning classes.

It is beyond the scope of this short article to go into the details of these
systems. I encourage you to read the documentation, these tools have helped me
immensely, they're very good, and I can't recommend them enough. I've collected
some of the topics below!

### rlang
- [Error calls](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-error-call.html)
- [Error chaining](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-error-chaining.html)
- [Formatting error messages](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-formatting.html)
- [Customising messages](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-customisation.html)

## Ok, so why should I use a result object pattern instead of exceptions then?

Ah well, my argument and motivation for this package is _not_ that people should
use result objects instead of exceptions, and I'll make no grand assertions as
to the absolute unquestioned superiority of one way over another. I'm a
"right tool for the right moment" kind of person
